# grafana-observability-ec2

This project aims to provide setup for a Grafana Observability Stack by utilising Grafana OSS (Open Source) on AWS EC2 Instances.

Single Tenant mode only so please do note that this setup is not fit for "Production Ready".

All components are hosted on same server so lacks HA & FT.
